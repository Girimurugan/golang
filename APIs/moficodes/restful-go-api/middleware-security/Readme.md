# Middleware and Security

In this section we will be talking about middleware and security. The topic may seem a little unrelated but implementation wise they go hand in had.

## Try it out

To run the code in this section

```bash
git checkout origin/middleware-security-04
```

If you are not already in the folder

```bash
cd middleware-security
```

```bash
go run main.go
```

```bash
curl localhost:7999
```

## Middleware

Middleware is a function that wraps our handler. Thats all. 

```go
func Middleware(h handler) handler
```

This simple implementation has alot of power. In go functions can be passed in to other functions as a parameter. 

Say we want to add a log to every request we are serving that prints out the URL of the request. 

We can do that by creating our own middleware like so.

```go
func Logger(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    log.Println(r.URL)
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
  })
}
```

and then wrapping our main router

```go
log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, Logger(r)))
```

On any request made to our server it will now print out the url of request on every request.

## Chaining Middlewares

Middlewares are useful tools and often one is not enough. If we want to add more of these middlewares we can keep on wrapping our router with our middlewares.

For example

```go
...SomeOtherMiddlerware(OtherMiddlerWare(Logger(r)))
```

There is couple of other ways to do this.

```go
// Chain applies middlewares to a http.HandlerFunc
func Chain(f http.Handler, middlewares ...func(next http.Handler) http.Handler) http.Handler {
  for _, m := range middlewares {
    f = m(f)
  }
  return f
}
```

Then we can use our middlewares like this,

```go
Chain(r, Logger, OtherMiddlerWare, SomeOtherMiddlerware, ...)
```

This in my opinion is a bit cleaner implementation.

In gorilla mux we have another option to do this.

Router has a method  `Use` that takes an array of Middlewares. This is useful to add middlewares to subrouters.

## Mux Handlers

Gorilla mux has a module named handlers. Its a collection of useful middleware handlers for gorilla mux. 

We can make use of one of these middlewares to make a better logger for our routes.

```go
func MuxLogger(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return handlers.LoggingHandler(os.Stdout, next)
}
```

We add this middleware in our chain

```go
  log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, Chain(r, MuxLogger, Logger)))
```

And the output we get is,

```bash
2020/08/07 03:44:59 /api/v1/users
2020/08/07 03:44:59 /api/v1/users 901.821Âµs
::1 - - [07/Aug/2020:03:44:59 -0400] "GET /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1" 200 96107
```

The first line comes from our `Logger` middleware. 
The second line is from the `Time` middleware.
And finally the third line is from the `MuxLogger` that is using the `LoggingHandler` middleware from mux.

>The mux Logger middleware gets the http status code of the response being sent out. If we wanted, we could have implemented something like that ourselves. We would need to use a http hijacker and a custop response writer.

## JWT Authentication

JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) method for representing claims securely between two parties. It is very easy to verify JWT tokens in go.

We make use of the very popular [jwt-go](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go#example-Parse--Hmac) library to validate a JWT Token. 

In this example we will be validating a JWT token that we generate in [jwt.io](jwt.io) website. With a payload (feel free to use any name or even any other payload here)

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

And for secret we use a string `very-secret` (goes without saying this is a secret so generate a longer more random string for your application). this will generate us a jwt token. If you dont want to go throught the trouble to generate this yourself, you can use this.

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSm9obiBEb2UifQ.wSzHi09b5o8aSjDHjlGxED9Cg-_-8T6lTWZjs6_Netg
```

We write a new function called `JWTAuth` which is a middleware. In this we check for the Header with key `Authorization`. There is no rule that says token should be sent in this manner. But this in convention and many apps will expect to get the token in this header. So its best practice to keep it there.

We get the claim and attach it to the request context as extra data so we can get it in our handler when needed.

In our `handlerFunc` we get the value from context and respond back with the users name.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSm9obiBEb2UifQ.wSzHi09b5o8aSjDHjlGxED9Cg-_-8T6lTWZjs6_Netg" http://localhost:7999/auth/test
```

Our server should respond back with
```json
{
  "message": "hello John Doe"
}
```
